## Functionality and Changes Made  
* **Home Page** : The Home page contain current date and users name.
    * *Changes: Total number of transaction was removed from this page. Instead a button that takes you to the page to add transaction was added. I did so because the button seems more useful and makes a less cluttered design*
* **User Reports Page**: Show average spending by category using a pie chart and the total Number of transactions logged 
    * Changes: Visual contain Average spending data per month was removed. This app does ot allow to filter by month and year. Hence, a particular month will include that month of all year, making the data inaccurate and does not serve the orginal purpose 
    * Displaying visuals for every month also creates a cluttered and filled UI. 
* **Login and Sign up Pages** : Uses firebase authenication to add a user,  log a user in, and display error messages. Automatically logged out when you exit the app for security. No requirements of these pages were changed. 
* **Transaction Dairy** : Display all previous transaction logged by the user. User can pick which category they wish to see or if they wish to see all transaction. No requirements of these pages were changed 
* **Search page** : User can search a product in the logs. Not case sensitive. Has to be an exact match.No requirements of these pages were changed.
